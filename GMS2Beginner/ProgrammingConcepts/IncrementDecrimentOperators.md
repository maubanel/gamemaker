## Increment and Decrement Operators

> **Increment/Decrement Operator**

> "++ and -- will add or subtract one from a value. It is worth noting that placing this before or after the value to be added to or subtracted from will have slightly different results. For example: 
> * ++a will increment the variable and return the incremented value. 
> * a++ will increment the variable but return the value before it was incremented." GameMaker Manual
